ğŸ’¡ **Merge Intervals**

Given an arrayÂ ofÂ `intervals`Â whereÂ `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and returnÂ *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*.

**Example 1:**
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10000`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10000`
